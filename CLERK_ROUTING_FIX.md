# Clerk Routing Configuration Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the Clerk `<SignIn/>` and `<SignUp/>` component configuration error by switching from path-based routing to hash-based routing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Login Page (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
- Changed `routing="path"` to `routing="hash"`
- Removed `path="/login"` prop (not needed for hash routing)

### 2. Updated Register Page (`src/app/register/page.tsx`)
- Changed `routing="path"` to `routing="hash"`
- Removed `path="/register"` prop (not needed for hash routing)

## Why This Fix Works

Clerk's SignIn/SignUp components with `routing="path"` require either:
1. **Catch-all routes**: `/login/[[...rest]]/page.tsx` structure, OR
2. **Hash-based routing**: `routing="hash"` (simpler, works with `/login/page.tsx`)

Since we're using the standard Next.js App Router structure (`/login/page.tsx`), hash-based routing is the appropriate solution.

## Benefits of Hash Routing
- ✅ Works with standard Next.js page structure
- ✅ No need to refactor to catch-all routes
- ✅ Clerk handles internal navigation via URL hash
- ✅ Maintains all functionality (redirects, returnTo, etc.)
- ✅ Compatible with middleware configuration

## Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/login`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/register`
4. Both pages should now render Clerk components without configuration errors

## Middleware Compatibility
The existing middleware configuration remains unchanged and works perfectly with hash routing:
```typescript
publicRoutes: [
  "/login(.*)",
  "/register(.*)",
  // ... other routes
]
```

The `(.*)` pattern still correctly protects all sub-paths under `/login` and `/register`.
